## Comments on quiz
- Issues can be found in [Issues](https://github.com/Archieru/natera/issues)
- Test results can be found in [Actions](https://github.com/Archieru/natera/actions)
- Added a [function](https://github.com/Archieru/natera/blob/master/src/test/java/com/bar42/natera/Base.java#L44) for quiz purposes only. Function covers:
  - Reflection
  - Threads
  - Serialization/Deserialization
- Not all test listed here should be performed this way:
  - Most of the calculations (area, perimeter) should be executed as unit tests - not the API tests
  - A bit of duplication exists for status code tests: some of them are already tested in different places (like when we add triangles)
  - Some status codes should not be tested because we should not test the Spring framework.
- Not all status codes described in documentstion:
  - 405: method not allowed if you try to POST to a given trialgle directly ([test](https://github.com/Archieru/natera/blob/master/src/test/java/com/bar42/natera/HttpCodesTest.java#L38) added)
  - 415: unknown charset if charset is not set to JSON in POST method ([test](https://github.com/Archieru/natera/blob/master/src/test/java/com/bar42/natera/HttpCodesTest.java#L49) added)
- Not all triangle issues are covered with requirements
  - Triangles with negative sides are accepted ([fails](https://github.com/Archieru/natera/commit/f83325e7f4fe55d41ce417076ef3c57563ac2350/checks?check_suite_id=331724683) a [test](https://github.com/Archieru/natera/blob/master/src/test/java/com/bar42/natera/AddTriangleTest.java#L47))
  - Triangles with zero area (technically - lines) are acceptes ([fails](https://github.com/Archieru/natera/commit/f83325e7f4fe55d41ce417076ef3c57563ac2350/checks?check_suite_id=331724683) a [test](https://github.com/Archieru/natera/blob/master/src/test/java/com/bar42/natera/AddTriangleTest.java#L69))
- Rate limiting:
  - Allows to store 11 triangles instead of 10  ([fails](https://github.com/Archieru/natera/commit/f83325e7f4fe55d41ce417076ef3c57563ac2350/checks?check_suite_id=331724683) a [test](https://github.com/Archieru/natera/blob/master/src/test/java/com/bar42/natera/RateLimitingTest.java#L20))
- I prefer more conversation during the work - this solves most of the questions before they even appear
